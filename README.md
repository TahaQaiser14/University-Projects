The project is an implementation of an online shopping system with both console and graphical user interfaces (GUI). It allows a manager to manage products by adding, deleting, printing, and saving them through a console menu. Additionally, it provides a GUI for users to view and select products, add them to a shopping cart, and visualize the final price. The GUI includes features such as sorting products, displaying product details, applying discounts, and showing the shopping cart with the final price. The project also includes testing and validation procedures, along with a coursework report and a video demonstration of the implemented functionalities.
